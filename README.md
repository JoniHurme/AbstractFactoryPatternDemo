# Demo project for showcasing Abstract Factory Pattern


FactoryMethod package hold the demo for normal Factory Method which I think is important to understand when trying to learn Abstract Factory Pattern.
## How to run in a terminal
This is written in Java in its entirety. If you wish to see if it works, you will need to install the java Development Kit (JDK). It can be found from here. https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

After you have installed JDK and downloaded the project on your system, you need to go into the `src` directory. After that do the following:
 - run `javac Main.java`
 - run `java Main`

If you want to run the Factory Method file do the same but move into the correct directory and replace the `javac Main.java` with `javac Factorymethod.java` and run it with `java FactoryMethod`

## Other things worth mentioning

Astiat (Dish), Aterimet (Cutlery), Tehataat (Factories) packages hold the corresponding files.

If you see this and notice that something is incorrect please let me know.
